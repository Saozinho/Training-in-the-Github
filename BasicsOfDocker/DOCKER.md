## Docker 

- Docker is an open-source platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers.

- It enables developers to create, test, and deploy applications in a consistent and repeatable way across different environments.

- Docker simplifies the process of deploying and scaling applications by abstracting away the underlying infrastructure.

## Docker Image and Container 

- In simple terms, a Docker image is a blueprint or a template that defines the environment and dependencies required to run an application. It includes all the necessary components such as code, libraries, and system tools.

- On the other hand, a Docker container is an instance of an image that is running as a process on your computer. It is a lightweight and portable executable package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the image itself, application code, system tools, and libraries.

- In other words, an image is a static file that can be used to create multiple containers, while a container is a running instance of an image that can be executed on a host machine.

## Docker images

- A Docker image is a read-only template or blueprint that contains the instructions for creating a Docker container.

- It includes all the necessary components such as code, libraries, and system tools required to run an application.

- Docker images are stored in a registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry, and can be pulled and used to create containers on any host machine.

## Docker containers

- A Docker container is a lightweight and portable executable package that contains everything needed to run an application, including the image itself, application code, system tools, and libraries.

- Containers are isolated from the host and other containers, providing a secure and predictable environment for running applications.

- Docker containers can be easily created, started, stopped, moved, and deleted, making it easy to deploy and manage applications at scale.

- Overall, Docker enables developers to build, package, and deploy applications in a consistent and repeatable way, while also providing portability and scalability through the use of Docker images and containers.
