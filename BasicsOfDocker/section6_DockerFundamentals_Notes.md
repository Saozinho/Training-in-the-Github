## Creating Docker image

```
    //this creates an image named web1
    $docker image build -t web1 .
``` 
```
//this removes an image named web1 with specific version
    $docker image rm web1:1.0
```

```
//this creating a tag name from wengdt/web1:latest and creating image with tag name web1
$docker image tag web1 wengdt/web1:latest
```

```
//this push the image to docker hub
$docker image push wengdt/web1:latest
```

```
//Running Docker Container naming web1_3 running on local host:5000
//-t:  flag tags in our image
    $docker container run -it --name web1_3 -p 5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -d --restart on-failure web1
//stops running container
    $docker container stop 'name of the container'
``` 

```
//Log in to a Docker registry
    $docker login
```
```
//enables live coding
    $docker container run -it -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py --rm --name web1 -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 -v "/d/Workspace/Training/Basics of Docker/assets/src:/app" web1
``` 

```
//Creates a custom network named firstnetwork
    $docker network create --driver bridge firstnetwork
//Creates container and assignig it to firstnetwork network
    $docker container run --rm -itd -p 6379:6379 --name firstnetwork redis redis
    $docker container run --rm -itd -p 5000:5000 -e FLASK_APP=app.py -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 --name web2 -v "/d/Workspace/Training/Basics of Docker/assets/link:/app" web2

//inspect network on firstnetwork
    $docker network inspect firsnetwork
```
- A bridge network uses a software bridge to allow communication between containers connected to the same network while isolating them from containers that are not connected to that network. The Docker bridge driver automatically installs rules in the host machine to prevent direct communication between containers on different bridge networks.

- The overlay network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. This network sits on top of the host-specific networks, enabling secure communication among containers connected to it, including swarm service containers. Docker handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker daemon host and the correct destination container.

- Volumes are the preferred method for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are easier to back up or migrate than bind mounts and can be managed using Docker CLI commands or the Docker API. Volumes work on both Linux and Windows containers and can be safely shared among multiple containers. Volume drivers allow storage of volumes on remote hosts or cloud providers, encrypt the contents of volumes, or add other functionality. Additionally, new volumes can have their content pre-populated by a container. Finally, volumes on Docker Desktop have significantly better performance than bind mounts from Mac and Windows hosts.
