**GIT**

- Is a version control sofware. It is a database system that watches file changes on your system , keeps track of them and stores into git folder called .git

**What Git Can do?**

- It knows Exactly what is change and which file has been changed.

- Either continue to save or Revert the changes at any point of the History.
- Allows you to upgrade the version without taking any risk.

- Git provides a range of features to help developers manage changes to their code, including branching and merging, which allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase without interfering with each other's work. It also includes tools for resolving conflicts that arise when multiple developers make changes to the same file.

- Git is widely used in software development because it provides an efficient and reliable way to manage changes to code. Its distributed nature means that developers can work on their own local copies of a project's codebase, even when they are not connected to the internet, and then merge their changes with the rest of the team's code when they are ready.
