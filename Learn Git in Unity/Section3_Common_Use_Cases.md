# Section 3 Common Use Cases


**Stashing** is a feature in Git that allows developers to temporarily save changes to a working directory without committing them to the repository. This can be useful when you need to switch to a different branch or work on a different task without losing your current changes.

**Branch** is a separate line of development that allows developers to work on different features or changes to a project without affecting the main codebase. Each branch has its own set of commits, changes, and history, and can be merged back into the main branch when the changes are complete.

**Reverting** a commit creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by the original commit, effectively "rolling back" the code to a previous state.
