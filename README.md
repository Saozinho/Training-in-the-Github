# Training-in-the-Github

**This repository contains all my learnings and understanding on my 2 weeks period in training.**  

What I DID:  

- Watched streams of video tutorials and following what the course is doing.
- Upgrading some versions since the technologies are outdated already.
- Cross referencing of information from the course and to another platforms. 
- Taking important Notes.
- Taking some 1 on 1 lectures with my teammates and asking for advice.

What I will be doing in the future:

- Keep the grind going.
- Always keep up to date to the latest versions of the technologies being used.
- Practice Coding, Building Projects.
- Don't stop learning.


What I need to improve: 

- I learned a lot in my training but I need more practice to be robust in what I'm doing.
